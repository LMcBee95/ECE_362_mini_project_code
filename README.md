			DigiNerf Gun
				 
	Synopsis:
		    This project was to modfiy a boring one speed completely analog Nerf
		 Rapidstrike blaster into something that is "socially redeeming" as my
		 ECE 362 professor would put it.  Using the required Freescale 9S12C32
		 microcontroller (It is a really old microcontroller but I can't do
		 anything about it).  Overall, this project was good enough to get 6th
		 place out of a little more than 50 teams at Purdue's Spring 2016
		 SparkChallenge.
	      The major software features of this gun include:
	          x Multiple firing option
	          x Variable firing speed
	          x Battery monitoring
	          x Piston arm reset incase of jamming
